# prettier-plugin-wp-block-html

Prettier plugin for HTML in WordPress Block Theme.

## ⚠️ Attention

This plugin does not work properly. This repository is for verification purposes only.

## Assumptions

Use the Prettier built-in HTML Parser & Printer whenever possible to avoid unnecessary maintenance. This is because WordPress block HTML is almost the same as regular HTML.

## Development

```shell
$ npm install
$ npm run build
$ npm run prettier
```
